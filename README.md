This tool allow you to unpack Animal-Crossing-Pocket-Camp-Complete saves and repack it
Files which his name start with "__" are raw data and can be directly edited
Files that was json are deserialized files and can be edited
If a file was a binary file you should dont edit it if you dont know what you do

This is not a save editor, so the tool will not verify if the data you edited was correct and wont corrupt you file (Even if iirc if you made bad change the tool could throw error when re-serialize)

If you want an actual save editor you can try this one : https://github.com/MyShiLingStar/PCCE
